## Documentation instructions
Semantic Versioning, is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey meaning about the underlying changes in a release. It does this by breaking down version numbers into three segments: **MAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH**.

**MAJOR:** This is the first digit in the version number. It is increased when there are incompatible API changes. This means that if software is using version X.Y.Z and there's an update with a higher X, it implies that the new version may break compatibility with the previous one. Users of the software might need to make changes to their code to adapt to the new version.

**MINOR:** This is the second digit in the version number. It is increased for backward-compatible new features or enhancements. For example, if new functionality is added in a way that doesn't break existing code, the MINOR version is incremented.

**PATCH:** The third digit, PATCH, is for backward-compatible bug fixes. If there are only minor changes or bug fixes that do not introduce new features or break existing ones, then the PATCH version is updated.

The date is recorded in the **YEAR**-**MONTH**-**DAY** format for all documentation. Versions are writen in the change log in order of youngest to oldest.
